But while #GtkCellRendererText offers a simple entry to\nedit the text, #GtkCellRendererSpin offers a #GtkSpinButton widget. Of course,\nthat means that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.\n\nThe range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the\ncell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the\ntree model, like all properties of cell renders. #GtkCellRendererSpin\nalso has properties for the #GtkCellRendererSpin:climb-rate and the number\nof #GtkCellRendererSpin:digits to display. Other #GtkSpinButton properties\ncan be set in a handler for the #GtkCellRenderer::editing-started signal.\n\nThe #GtkCellRendererSpin cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10."
