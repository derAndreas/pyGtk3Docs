See #GtkAdjustment for the fields in an adjustment - for\n#GtkScrollbar, the #GtkAdjustment.value field represents the position\nof the scrollbar, which must be between the #GtkAdjustment.lower field\nand #GtkAdjustment.upper - #GtkAdjustment.page_size. The\n#GtkAdjustment.page_size field represents the size of the visible\nscrollable area. The #GtkAdjustment.step_increment and\n#GtkAdjustment.page_increment fields are used when the user asks to\nstep down (using the small stepper arrows) or page down (using for\nexample the <keycap>PageDown</keycap> key)."
