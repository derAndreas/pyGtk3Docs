The values to display in the combo box are taken from\nthe tree model specified in the #GtkCellRendererCombo:model property.\n\nThe combo cell renderer takes care of adding a text cell renderer to the combo\nbox and sets it to display the column specified by its\n#GtkCellRendererCombo:text-column property. Further properties of the comnbo box\ncan be set in a handler for the #GtkCellRenderer::editing-started signal.\n\nThe #GtkCellRendererCombo cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.6."
