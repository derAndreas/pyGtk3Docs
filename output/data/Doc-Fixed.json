    "description": "The #GtkFixed widget is a container which can place child widgets\nat fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. #GtkFixed\nperforms no automatic layout management.\n\nFor most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps\nyou from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it\nresults in broken applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following\nthings will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and\nother display bugs:\n<itemizedlist>\n<listitem><para>\nThemes, which may change widget sizes.\n</para></listitem>\n<listitem><para>\nFonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course\nchange the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that\nusers may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the\ndefault, or they may be using Windows or the framebuffer port of\nGTK+, where different fonts are available.\n</para></listitem>\n<listitem><para>\nTranslation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,\ndisplay of non-English text will use a different font in many\ncases.\n</para></listitem>\n</itemizedlist>\n\nIn addition, the fixed widget can't properly be mirrored in\nright-to-left languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. i.e. normally\nGTK+ will flip the interface to put labels to the right of the\nthing they label, but it can't do that with #GtkFixed. So your\napplication will not be usable in right-to-left languages.\n\nFinally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove\nGUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other\nelements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your\napplication.\n\nIf you know none of these things are an issue for your application,\nand prefer the simplicity of #GtkFixed, by all means use the\nwidget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs."
