    "description": "#GtkHBox is a container that organizes child widgets into a single row.\n\nUse the #GtkBox packing interface to determine the arrangement,\nspacing, width, and alignment of #GtkHBox children.\n\nAll children are allocated the same height.\n\nGtkHBox has been deprecated. You can use #GtkBox instead, which is a\nvery quick and easy\u00a0change. If you have derived your own classes from\nGtkHBox, you can simply change the inheritance to derive directly\nfrom #GtkBox. No further changes are needed, since the default\nvalue of the #GtkOrientable:orientation property is\n%GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL.\nIf you want your code to be future-proof, the recommendation is to\nswitch to #GtkGrid, since #GtkBox is going to be deprecated in favor\nof the more flexible grid widget eventually. For more information\nabout migrating to #GtkGrid, see <xref linkend=\"gtk-migrating-GtkGrid\"/>"
