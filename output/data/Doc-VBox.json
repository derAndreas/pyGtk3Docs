    "description": "A #GtkVBox is a container that organizes child widgets into a single column.\n\nUse the #GtkBox packing interface to determine the arrangement,\nspacing, height, and alignment of #GtkVBox children.\n\nAll children are allocated the same width.\n\nGtkVBox has been deprecated. You can use #GtkBox instead, which is a\nvery quick and easy\u00a0change. If you have derived your own classes from\nGtkVBox, you can simply change the inheritance to derive directly\nfrom #GtkBox, and set the #GtkOrientable:orientation property to\n%GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL in your instance init function, with a\ncall like:\n|[\ngtk_orientable_set_orientation (GTK_ORIENTABLE (object),\nGTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL);\n]|\nIf you want your code to be future-proof, the recommendation is to\nswitch to #GtkGrid, since #GtkBox is going to be deprecated in favor\nof the more flexible grid widget eventually. For more information\nabout migrating to #GtkGrid, see <xref linkend=\"gtk-migrating-GtkGrid\"/>."
